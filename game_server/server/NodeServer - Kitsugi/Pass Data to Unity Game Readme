In order to passdata into the unity game:
    After embedding the game there is a required variable in the JS of that page.

    Something like this:
        var unityInstance = UnityLoader.instantiate("unityContainer", "Build/_Build.json", {onProgress: UnityProgess});

After the game is loaded, call this function:
    unityInstance.SendMessage('Networking','SetUsername',username);

What the function does:
    This will send a message to the given object (Networking)
    To the given function (SetUsername) on that object
    With the given arguments (username)
    
    That line must be exact. 
    The only thing that should vary is username and it should be a string of what the users username is.
    
    Example:
    unityInstance.SendMessage('Networking','SetUsername',Nicky-G);
